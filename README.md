# Image-classification-with-ViT-pytorch-implementation

## Overview
This repository is built for educational purposes on image classification using various computer vision models, including Vision Transformers (ViTs). The main goal is to demonstrate how these models can be applied to classify images and perform compared to contemporary models on widely known datasets. Much of the novel mechanisms developed and published by others (hopefully my own in the future as well) are reimplemented on this repository to demonstrate the intuition and advantages behind such mechanisms. Weights, results, and visual results will be provided as the repository develops. This repository contains implementations, training scripts, weights,and visual results for different image classification models in PyTorch.
